It was a Saturday morning when we visited our college friend in her first month of motherhood. We were lying on the sofa, watching the baby in the crook of her arm tried so hard to climb high and touch his mother's face; we laughed as my friend pointed out that the baby's neck was so soft and boneless that he could hardly hold up his own head. A four-week-old baby with bones and flesh growing under his thin skin.

Later when the baby got tired, his father placed him back in the cradle and gently wrapped him in blankets. This was another aha moment for the rest of us. The father explained that although babies' arms, unlike their necks, are fully developed, he cannot sense that those are his own arms. While sleeping, he'd hilariously cry out loud for help when he finds the arms in an uncomfortable position. The feedback mechanism doesn't yet exist to control his own part of the body.

Watching this tiny being gradually discover his own body made me think about how we come to know ourselves. It was around this time that I started reading this book. In one chapter, the author talked about people who experienced severe child abuse cannot recognize themselves in mirror, as the sense of 'self' is not an innate gift. The astounding question of "who am I" that bothers many of us is not guaranteed to human beings as a species, if you don't receive enough care and therefore cannot acquire the ability.

As the book stated in many places that our brain is programmed, via both chemical and electrical signals, to react to threat and hurt. The emotions created along the way are just conceptual summary of the fundamental physical responses, of increase in blood pressure and heartbeat, tingling, muscular tension and so on. The thoughts of self-doubt or hatred are natural responses as well; they help you unload the pain, learn to stay away from danger, and survive even in a civil society like our ancestors did when they lived in a wild world.

Therefore, my thoughts do not represent my true self; nothing might truly represent who I am, as the "self" is so illusory that given the same genetic characteristics and environmental stimuli, I might behave exactly like someone I consider completely different from me. We're, in this sense, more or less like a machine that with the same inputs, always reliably and accurately generates the same outputs.

Coincidentally, such perspective (so rudimentary that we probably heard about it in the first lecture of Biology 101) appeared in more than one films I watched recently during pandemic. One was the famous Ghost in the Shell, where both Motoko and Batou reflected their existence as "memory can be manipulated, cyborg replaced...mankind and its magnificent build are no more than a collective gene expression".

Impractical as it may be, the idea has deeply comforted me. When those dark moments fell, with hating the hate itself, I'd take a deep breath, imagining those parts of my brain the book had taught me about - my sympathetic nervous system firing, my amygdala on high alert - doing their job. I imagined they bombarded at each other, exploding like twinkle stars in a universe of the brain; they bumped into soft tissues, fragments spread all around, causing unbearable agony. From a swirling pool of endless darkness, the last crack of light I seize is that this could happen to anyone; I'm not alone.

There're other inspiring ideas in the book such as the Internal Family System therapy. The concept painted this picture of different parts within us - including what they call the Exiled Child. It was kind of amusing to think there's a rescue team shielding the "self" that I barely see what she looks like; and the phrase "hear your own voice" has never made more sense given it does help dissolve stress hormone and complete the cognition map of past experience. Another metaphor closely related to this is considering memory as a "dense but flexible network where each element exerts a subtle influence on many others". Here traumatic memory is like sharp fragment, piercing into a continuous flow of normal memory which might take the network so long to absorb, and even doing so might inevitably reshape the network to reflect the incongruous tragedy that would never be erased.

By the time I'm writing the review, it's the first day of 2021 and a month after finishing the book. Not all problems in my daily life were gone, but I did experienced more peace, partially from the book, partially from the end of a historical year and a blind confidence for the future. Later in the day, I called my parents, not for the first time but indeed rarely, asking how they celebrated New Year's Eve. And that's probably the best thing I learned from the book: knowing that the people who caused you pain were simultaneously victims, and it was never their intention to cause hurt in any relationship. In that sense, everyone just attempts to stay safe like what we've tried the entire 2020.

And in that sense, everyone is alone.
